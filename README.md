Fun algorithm visualizations with d3.js
Mostly a learning experience for moi - first web application using Django d3.js (or javascript, css, html for that matter...)
But I hope it ends up helping out students and other people interested in algorithms!

So far:
## Sorting Algorithms
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
## Flocking Algorithm
- Boids Algorithm by Craig Reynolds. Credits to [shuw](https://github.com/shuw/flock) for the d3 flock layout used in the visualization!
